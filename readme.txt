Displays a grid of observations from iNaturalist

== Description ==

Provides a Gutenberg block to display observations from iNaturalist. Photos are displayed in a square grid, with the species name and some ancillary data overlayed. Design was inspired by the grid view from the Calendar view on inaturalist.org. 

Authors have the option to pull observations based on the observer's username as well as a date range. Additionally, some basic formatting options allow customization.

== Development ==

Please submit feature requests or bug reports on github. I will attempt to add features as time and resources allow.
